# Culture_scout_NLP_Project

I was developing a CLI + Web Interface using Streamlit for businesses which will help them to gain control over insightful data like Name , organizations , contact details like emails plus phone number , addresses ; additionally i have also embedded a Large Language Model (roberta base squad v2) . Application can also perform personalized Q/A on any corpus of data like any Documents ,texts , websites which can save time of users as an intelligent system will be liable to give complex answers based on specific data , even by analysis of texts it can do sentiment analysis with graphs and chats in 3 different labels - positive , negative , neutral .

Feartures of the project:-
<ul>
  <li>Information Extraction from any large corpus of Data.</li>
  <li>Sentiment Analysis by giving prediction score to each lable [Positive, negative, neutral].</li>
  <li>Q/A on any given large textual data. (works like chatgpt)</li>
  <li>Content and context analysis of any given textual data</li>
</ul>
